    <h2>🧾 From the CEO's Desk</h2>
    <p>In a democratic country like India, people play the most important role in the governance of the country by choosing their representatives. For this purpose, the people must be aware of their electoral rights and exercise the same according to their judgement, uninfluenced by extraneous factors.</p>

    <p>Every adult citizen has a statutory right to get enrolled in the Electoral Roll of the constituency in the place of his ordinary residence. Accordingly, the elector is entitled to vote in the elections to choose the people's representatives and perform their democratic duty towards nation building.</p>
